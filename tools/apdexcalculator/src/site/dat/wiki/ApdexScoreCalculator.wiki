= Apdex Score Calculator Plugin =
One of the challenges when analyzing performance test results is to make a pass/fail call. Given your statistical summary results (average, min, max, percentiles etc.), you have to decide how close or far your application is from your SLAs.

The [http://www.apdex.org/ Apdex] (Application Performance Index) was precisely designed to make this task easier for you. It defines [https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/basic-concepts/ratings/apdex-ratings/ ratings] from "Unacceptable" up to "Excellent" that will help you find how your app stands out.

This plugin parses the results of a JMeter test and calculates the Apdex score and rating of every sampler. Apdex metric is also included in JMeter's [https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html Report Dash board]. But this plugin provides a quick and easy way to get the Apdex score at the end of a test without having to go through the full dash board report.

Once you have specified the Tolerated threshold, the plugin will compute the Apdex score of the samples and display the results in a table. In this table, when the number of samples is less than 100, the plugin will mark them as "Small Group" as a precaution. You can export this table into a file should you wish to add the Apdex results in your test report.

== Setup ==
Download the plugin using the JMeter Plugins Manager.<br>
Then add the plugin to a Test Plan via the "Add > Non-Test Elements" menu.

== Usage via the GUI ==
=== Apdex Calculations ===
Specify the JMeter results file and your Satisfied Threshold T in seconds (default value is 4s) and hit "Calculate".<br>
The plugin parses the data and shows the results in a grid, together with their Apdex rating.

If your target threshold is given in milliseconds, then convert it to seconds before entering T. For instance, if you want to check APIs against a threshold of 500ms, enter T as "0.5".

=== Saving the Apdex results ===
By clicking on the "Save" button, the plugin will copy the Apdex results into a csv file which you can then import into your final test report.

== Usage via Command Line ==
You can call the Apdex calculator in a script as in the following example:

<code>java -jar {YourJMeterInstall}\lib\cmdrunner-2.2.jar --tool ApdexScoreCalculator --input-file inputfile.jtl --trhld 0.5</code>

Parameters are:
--input-file: <filenameIn> --trhld <target threshold in seconds>

The tool will save the results of the Apdex computation in a "_ApdexScore.csv" file.
